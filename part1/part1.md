# Part 1 - discovery process 

## Guidelines

You are encouraged to work on these problems as a group. 

Save  the .pdf locally to get a fillable .pdf (and open in Adobe Reader, not in a browser, to avoid losing the edits). 

Assign and perform roles (put full names on the worksheet): 
* The Manager (or Coordinator) keeps track of time and helps the team to stay on task. 
* The Presenter (or Spokesperson) speaks on behalf of the team when reporting out and asking questions. 
* The Recorder (or Quality Control) reviews notes and helps the team reach consensus. 
* The Reflector (or Process Analyst) observes and comments on team dynamics.

If you have 3 people on the team, combine the first two (Manager and Presenter). 
If you have 2 people, also combine the second two (Recorder and Reflector).

Each student will need to submit the file produced by their group in their Github classroom assignment.   
 
The activity asks you to download a data file; a local copy is provided in a file ```scorecard.csv```.


## Jupiter notebook
Practice working with Jupyter notebooks in this assignment. 
* One of easiest ways to use them would be to start Anaconda Navigator (if you don't see a menu icon, run a search on your computer for it). This should bring up a window with installed applications; among them you should see Jupyter Notebook.
* Another simple way is to use Google Colaboratory: Google Drive -> New ->More-> Connect more apps, search for Colaboratory and give it necessary permissions.

*For how to work with Jupyter notebook, see this [tutorial](
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) (up to but not including Example Analysis part). Execute everything suggested by the tutorial in your notebook and observe the results. Ignore the parts that you don't completely understand on the â€€first pass, and come back to them later.]*
